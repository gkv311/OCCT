Cascade Technologia Septima 7.X (in development)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This version provides a smooth evolution of OCCT since version 7.7, and focused on:
- Updated 3rd-parties to latest versions and improved *CMake* scripts
  (*Tcl 9+*, *FFmpeg 7+*, *FreeType*, *Bison 3.8.2*, *Emscripten 4+*).
- Improved stability and reproducibility of algorithms
  (fixed uninitialized memory, inappropriate usage of unordered maps, removal of some global variables,
   eliminated warnings from newest compilers, replaced unsafe `sprintf` with `snprintf`).
- Improved regression testing system, CI/CD and test base based on publicly available dataset.
- *Back-porting 100+ changes from OCCT 7.8 and OCCT 7.9 releases*,
  avoiding dramatic changes in API, project structure and regressions.
- Improvements, fixes and new features in Visualization module
  (HiDPI support across platforms, Wayland support, image plugins, text formatter, and others).
- Adaptation of OCCT classes / iterators for **C++ range-based loops**.

The highlights in more details:
- **Configuration**
   - **Tcl**: fixed compatibility issues with *Tcl 9.0*.
   - **FFmpeg**: code ported to API changes in FFmpeg and now requires *FFmpeg 7.0+*;
                 added support to `Image_AlienPixMap`.
   - **MinGW**: added `.dll.a` lookup and `.rc` embedding (DLL information).
   - **Linux**:
     - fixed auto-detection of system Draco library, added `-Wl,--no-undefined` and `-Wl,--as-needed` flags;
     - added handling of `BUILD_FORCE_RelWithDebInfo` option;
     - fixed treating of `BUILD_SOVERSION_NUMBERS=0` option to generate `.so` files without version;
     - added handling of `GNUInstallDirs`.
   - **WebAssembly**: fixed runtime issues within `WASM64` (`-sMEMORY64=1`), fixed building issues with Emscripten 4.x;
   - **MSVC**: removed `#pragma comment(lib, "libX")` from code, fixed unescaped quotes within generated config file;
   - Common: removed redundant building macros;
             removed modification of `custom.sh` within INSTALL location during configure step.
   - Removed legacy `TKIVtk` toolkit and optional *VTK* dependency (*VTK9* introduced dependency from OCCT).

  {
    const TopoDS_Face& aFace = TopoDS::Face(aFaceIter);
  }
